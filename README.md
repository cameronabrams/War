# ThermoProblems
> A Python package to enable high-throughput generation of problems suitable for exams and problem sets for Thermodynamics courses

You may have learned how to use Python to solve thermodynamics problems, like equilibrium compositions for a reacting system, or phase compositions in vapor-liquid equilibrium.  `ThermoProblems` takes this idea and uses Python to generate new problems in the form of LaTeX.  `ThermoProblems` relies on the `pythontex` package in LaTeX to allow Python code to be run during document compilation and results of those calculations automatically included in the document.  `ThermoProblems` includes the pure-properties database that originally accompanied the textbook _Chemical, Biochemical, and Engineering Thermodynamics_ (4th edition) by Stan Sandler (Wiley, USA).

## Installation

`ThermoProblems` is in development.  Best to install it that way.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cameronabrams/ThermoProblems.git
cd ThermoProblems
pip install -e .
```

## Usage example

Consider the following file `Example1.tex`:
```
\input{SimpleHeader}
\begin{pycode}
from ThermoProblems.Chem.Properties import PureProperties
Prop=PureProperties()
A=Prop.get_compound('n-butane')
restr=A.report_as_tex()
\end{pycode}
\begin{document}
\noindent Here is some information about \py{A.name}:\\*[2em]
\py{restr}
\end{document}
```
Compiling this like so:
```sh
pdflatex Example1
pythontex Example1
pdflatex Example1
```
yields:
